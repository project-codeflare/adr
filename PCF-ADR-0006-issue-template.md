## What
Currently when creating github issues for repositories within Project Codeflare we do not use any templates. The aim of this ADR is to propose adding a defined selection of templates that will allow team members to include all relevant information when creating an issue which will allow others to effectively pick it up and complete it.

## Why

This change will effect all repositories across the stack and therefore all stakeholders should be involved in the process. This ADR aims to document 3 proposed templates for discussion within the team.

## Goals

* Addition of relevant templates for creating issues in any of the Project Codeflare repositories.

## How

The proposal includes the addition of 3 templates via a drop down menu which will be available when creating an issue. The proposed templates are as follows:

1. Feature Request

    ### Name of Feature or Improvement

    TL;DR of what you are requesting...

    ### Description of Problem the Feature Should Solve

    A clear and concise description of the problem the proposal would address. E.g., "I'm frequently frustrated when X happens." "It's too tedious/confusing to do Y."

    ### Describe the Solution You Would Like to See

    Description of the proposed solution.

    ### Describe Alternatives You Have Considered

    Description of any alternative solutions or features you have considered.
